# Algorighms and Data Structures
## Practical Assignment 2 - Dutch Thriftiness
### Submission group 88: Freek van den Bergh (s4801709) and Max Driessen (s4789628)

This repository contains our code for the Dutch Thriftiness assignment of Algorithms and Data Structures. 
+ `algorithm.py` contains our "simple or greedy" algorithm, as well as a brute-force algorithm
+ `utils.py` contains some utility functions used in our algorithm (as well as in the brute-force algorithm)
+ `input_output.py` contains code for server interaction
+ `0main.py` file is the file that needs to run on the server (`algorithm.py`, `input_output.py` and `utils.py` are also required for running on the server)
+ `test_offline.py` and `example_problems.py` contain code for testing the algorithm without the server, using the brute-force algorithm for verification purposes
